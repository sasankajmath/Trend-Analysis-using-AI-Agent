      "[\"I am a swiggy one member and Yesterday I ordered food. The packaging was open and food items were missing i reported this issue. However, my tickets were force closed without any resolution. No one contacted me back. It's a hard earned money I never had this much issues with Zomato. Very much disappointed. Still I am not able to get any option to chal or talk to any representative. Pathetic service I have ever recieved.\", \"Such a horrible app. I have purchased swiggy one membership. Few days back I've placed an order and the restaurant has cancelled my order with reason that item is out of stock then again after some time I've placed another order from the same restaurant with a thought that might be this time the item is available but again the same thing happened they cancelled my order again without taking my permission. They were keep calling me I received no. Of calls just for the cancellation.\", 'Very shameless app you can see on paly store Worst app, there resturent serves insects khichdi and than tell uas we are regret and after that no refund better to switch to zomato, or Amazon food and really fraud app apart of this the mail id is the biggest fraud you will die old but no reply', 'very nice app and with clean', 'pethetic app.. delivery person directly cancel orders... and customer service is also not supported... dont waste ur money and time...', \"I took my time out to review this. THIS IS THE BEST APP FOR FAST GROCERIES ONLINE!!! I'm talking about the Instamart!! Maybe I just got lucky with location or something.. Idk but... The delivery, the packaging, the timing and the payments...everything is *chef's kiss*!! It doesn't hoard your phone with ads and update notifications either.. I just love this app!!! ❤️\", 'delivery location is always wrong', '0 *s. Got this SMS, (Our Delivery Executive has been trying 2 reach you on your registered #. Please reach out to him with an alternate # so that we can have the order delivered to you at the earliest. Post 10 min of this SMS your order will be cancelled in case there is no response from your end. -Swiggy) clearly indicates they want free money. If agent is not able to connect, how can I contact to give another number. Further, threatening order will be cancelled. Kudos. What more to write???', \"This update is bakwas Colour less It's seems that thr is noting left in this aap\", 'Rate of the foods were overly charged as more than in the restaurant. There is a huge difference btwn the rates.']\n"
